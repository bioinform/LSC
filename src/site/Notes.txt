Run LSC Stages
	Remove duplicate short reads
	Split the SR FASTQ across CPUs
		Thread1 is for the alignment/SRs
		Run HC over the split SR input
		Creates cps and idx files
	Remove the tails (shorter bits) from the LR, which SHOULD also be the overlapping DNA compliment
	Compress the long reads
	Alignment
		Build the aligner index and then align short to long
		Parse the SAM file to NAV format if needed
	ConvertNAV to create the map files
	Create the tmp files
	Split the LR/SR map across CPUs
		thread2 for corrections, uses a bunch of memory
		thread1 > thread2
		Run correction
	Put everything back together
