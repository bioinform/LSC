.cps
	A sequence of bases after homopolymer compression
	cps files are FASTA formated, and contain compressed sequences
.readname
	A tab separated table
	Maps a read index number to it's original name
	See .fa
.fa
	Similar to FASTA file
	Reads are indexed (not named)
	Each read has all it's bases on one line (no splitting)
	See .readname
.idx
	Tab separated index file generated during homopolymer compression
	0: readindex_repeatcount, the read index followed by an underscore and then the number of times it was reapeated
	1: Position of compression point in the compressed sequence (index into .cps)
	3: Repeat count of the corresponding compression point

.nav
	Natived/Novoalign format
	Tab separated table of alignment data
	Probably not sorted by position
	0: SR name (readindex_repeatcount in LSC), and negative if the complement of the short read mapped to the long read
	1: LR index to which the SR mapped
	2: Position (0 or 1 based??) in the LR at which the SR maps
	3: Space separated list of CIGARs
		Each cigar is a position followed (without a separator) by an operation as below
		X>Y is replace
		+X is insertion
		-X is deletion

.map
	Mapping file, created by convertNAV
	Has one line per long read with fields separated by tabs
	0: long read name (index)
	1: Semicolong separated list of NAV lines for that long read
		Each NAV line has been rewritten to be comma separated instead of tab
		(long read name/index in these NAV lines is duplicate info, of course)
.tmp
	Temporary file for LSC correction
	Has one line per long read, with fields in a line separated by "yue"
	0: cps for long read
	1: idx for long read
	2: map data
		See .map format
		may be reordered, may be sorted after writetmp
	3: LR name/index
	4: Short reads (cps), separated by "kinfai"
	5: Short read (idx), separated by "kinfai"
